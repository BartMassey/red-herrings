The device has an instruction panel and an 'on' switch. Four trays are on top of the device, labeled 'Tray 1' through 'Tray 4'. Each tray is big enough to hold many objects.</span>&quot; The description is &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">tray contents</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;.

Valuable prizes await!</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">But watch out for the red herrings! You don't want any of those. Some of them are hard to spot, so be careful.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Check switching on the judging device: if something on a tray is a red herring or the salmon sushi is not on Tray 1 or the anchor is not on Tray 2 or the Lincoln campaign pamphlet is not on Tray 3 or the eel pie is not on Tray 4, instead say &quot;<span class="quote">You need to get just the required items in their exact right places. Either the items are scrambled, or you've caught a red herring. (There might be several words you could spell with the given letters. When you see the right one, you'll know what it is.) Please read the instructions and try again.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Carry out switching on the judging device: end the game saying &quot;<span class="quote">You triumphantly spell SALE using the initial letters of your finds. This is the secret word, for sure and certain. Congratulations! Five gold doubloons and a subscription to Puzzles Magazine (edited by Grace Long) clunk from a slot on the bottom of the judging device.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">You win!</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p>
