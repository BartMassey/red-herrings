*Red Herrings* is a work of Interactive Fiction written by
participants of the 2012 Open Source Bridge Conference
during a 1.5 hour collaborative session headed by Bart
Massey. Bart subsequently touched it up after playtesting;
it is still something of a work-in-progress.

An easy way to try out the game is to visit the playable web
page at
