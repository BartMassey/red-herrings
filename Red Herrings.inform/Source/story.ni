When play begins: say "The panic over the supposed virus was sheer mass hysteria, but it was sufficient to clear out the Middletown Strip Mall. After a day or so, you venture into the mall to see what you can find of interest..."

Section - Strip Mall

The Strip Mall is a room. "This dingy strip mall has but a few shops. There is a deli / bakery to the north, a fish shop to the south, an antique shop to the northwest, and a memorabilia store to the southwest."

Section - Judging Device

A tray is a kind of supporter. Tray 1 and Tray 2 and Tray 3 and Tray 4 are trays. Every tray is part of the judging device. 

To say the contents of (tray accounted - a tray): say "[tray accounted]: [list of things on tray accounted].".

To say tray account: say "The trays are currently filled as follows:[line break]"; repeat with the tray accounted running through trays begin; say the contents of the tray accounted; end repeat.

To say tray contents: if something is on the tray, say tray account; otherwise say "The trays currently sit empty."

The judging device is a fixed in place device in the Strip Mall. "A booth on the street contains a judging device. The device has an instruction panel and an 'on' switch. Four trays are on top of the device, labeled 'Tray 1' through 'Tray 4'. Each tray is big enough to hold many objects." The description is "[tray contents]". Understand "trays" as the judging device.

An instruction panel is part of the judging device. The description is "Find four objects in the shops of the strip mall, and arrange them on the trays such that the first letters of the items form a word. Valuable prizes await!

But watch out for the red herrings! You don't want any of those. Some of them are hard to spot, so be careful."

Check switching on the judging device: if something on a tray is a red herring or the salmon sushi is not on Tray 1 or the anchor is not on Tray 2 or the Lincoln campaign pamphlet is not on Tray 3 or the eel pie is not on Tray 4, instead say "You need to get just the required items in their exact right places. Either the items are scrambled, or you've caught a red herring. (There might be several words you could spell with the given letters. When you see the right one, you'll know what it is.) Please read the instructions and try again."

Carry out switching on the judging device: end the game saying "You triumphantly spell SALE using the initial letters of your finds. This is the secret word, for sure and certain. Congratulations! Five gold doubloons and a subscription to Puzzles Magazine (edited by Grace Long) clunk from a slot on the bottom of the judging device.

You win!"
