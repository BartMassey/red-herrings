After a day or so, you venture into the mall to see what you can find of interest...</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The story headline is &quot;<span class="quote">A Treasure Hunt Puzzle</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Release along with the library card, a website, cover art and the source text.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Use no scoring.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The Strip Mall is a room. &quot;<span class="quote">This dingy strip mall has but a few shops. There is a deli / bakery to the north, a fish shop to the south, an antique shop to the northwest, and a memorabilia store to the southwest.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">A thing can be a red herring. A thing is usually a red herring.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">A solution piece is a kind of thing. A solution piece is not a red herring.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The tiny red fish is in the Strip Mall. &quot;<span class="quote">A tiny red fish is lying on the street. An obvious red herring.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The judging device is a fixed in place device in the Strip Mall. &quot;<span class="quote">A booth on the street contains a judging device. The device has an instruction panel and an 'on' switch. Four trays are on top of the device, labeled 'Tray 1' through 'Tray 4'. Each tray is big enough to hold many objects.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">An instruction panel is part of the judging device. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Find four objects in the shops of the strip mall, and arrange them on the trays such that the first letters of the items form a word. Valuable prizes await!</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">But watch out for the red herrings! You don't want any of those. Some of them are hard to spot, so be careful.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">A tray is a kind of supporter. Tray 1 and Tray 2 and Tray 3 and Tray 4 are trays. Every tray is part of the judging device. </p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Check switching on the judging device: if something on a tray is a red herring or the salmon sushi is not on Tray 1 or the anchor is not on Tray 2 or the Lincoln campaign pamphlet is not on Tray 3 or the eel pie is not on Tray 4, instead say &quot;<span class="quote">You need to get just the required items in their exact right places. Either the items are scrambled, or you've caught a red herring. (There might be several words you could spell with the given letters. When you see the right one, you'll know what it is.) Please read the instructions and try again.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Carry out switching on the judging device: end the game saying &quot;<span class="quote">You triumphantly spell SALE using the initial letters of your finds. This is the secret word, for sure and certain. Congratulations! Five gold doubloons and a subscription to Puzzles Magazine (edited by Grace Long) clunk from a slot on the bottom of the judging device.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">You win!</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Test me with &quot;<span class="quote">take all / turn on device / test fish-shop / test deli / test antique-shop / test memorabilia-shop / put sushi on tray 1 / put anchor on tray 2 / put pamphlet on tray 3 / put pie on tray 4 / put fish on tray 3 / turn on device / get fish / turn on device</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Test fish-shop with &quot;<span class="quote">s / x quilt / get key / unlock counter with key / open counter / get sushi / drop key / n</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Test deli with &quot;<span class="quote">n / get eel pie / s</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Test antique-shop with &quot;<span class="quote">nw / get anchor / se</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Test memorabilia-store with &quot;<span class="quote">sw / open frame / get pamphlet / ne</span>&quot;.</p><ul><li><a href=source_0.html>Chapter - Rooms</a></li>
