It looks more like a hole in the wall than a legitimate establishment. It smells fishy. The entrance is to the north.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">     </p><p class="indent0">    The Freezer is in the shop. The freezer is closed. The freezer is openable. The description of the freezer is &quot;<span class="quote">An ancient and eldritch freezer case. Encrusted in ice, you wonder what secrets it might hold.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">     </p><p class="indent0">    Some Swedish Fish are food in the freezer. The description of the Swedish Fish is &quot;<span class="quote">You never did understand why they were called 'Swedish Fish.' They're neither Swedish nor fish, as far as you know. They come in many colors: blue, green and red.</span>&quot; Understand &quot;<span class="quote">candy</span>&quot; as the Swedish Fish.</p><p class="indent0">     </p><p class="indent0">    The Canadian fish is vile food in the freezer. The description of the Canadian fish is &quot;<span class="quote">A herring impaled bloodily on a stick. A traditional snack of Canadians.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">     </p><p class="indent0">    The fish shop shelf is in the fish shop.

The description is &quot;<span class="quote">A rose-colored glass vase.</span>&quot; The vase bottom is part of the rose vase. The description of the vase bottom is &quot;<span class="quote">A herring is inscribed on the bottom of the vase.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">     </p><p class="indent0">    The Crimson Fish Key is a thing. The key unlocks the counter. Rule for supplying a missing second noun while unlocking when the player holds the Crimson Fish Key: now the second noun is the Crimson Fish Key; say &quot;<span class="quote">(with the Crimson Fish Key)[</span><span class="substitution">command clarification break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">     </p><p class="indent0">    The Counter is in the shop. The counter is closed. The counter is openable. The counter is locked. The counter can be locked or unlocked. The description of the counter is &quot;<span class="quote">A traditional glass counter case. You can see fish, raw and prepared, inside, beyond a veil of precipitation.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">     </p><p class="indent0">    The salmon sushi is an edible solution piece in the counter. The description of the sushi is &quot;<span class="quote">Sushi. Yummy sushi. Sticky, sticky, yummy sushi.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">     </p><p class="indent0">    The herringbone quilt is on the shelf. The description of the quilt is &quot;<span class="quote">A patchwork of pale pink fabric and herringbone.</span>&quot; After doing something to the quilt for the first time: say &quot;<span class="quote">You spy a key hiding underneath the quilt.</span>&quot;; now the key is on the shelf.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0"></p>
